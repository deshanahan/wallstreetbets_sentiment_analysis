# wallstreetbets_sentiment_analysis

# Introduction
The goal of the project is to make a user-friendly investment tool using live sentiment analysis from a Twitter stream, compare that data to data from a previous period to give investors real-time insight into a company of their choice.  

The team consists of Dylan Shanahan, Jason Mannion, and Askari Amir.  We are all interested in investing powered by data science and gaining an edge in the stock market.  

Hypothesis: We can compare live sentiment analysis to sentiment analysis from previous periods to make investment decisions.

# Similar Approaches
Below are some examples of previous research into investing sentiment analysis:

QuiverQuant has put together insights from wallstreetbets comments data including metrics such as most-mentioned stocks and a mentions vs. movement metric that plots the movement of the asset as measured by its daily high / daily low and plots it with color for sentiment and size for volume. - https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/

The novel approach is comparing live streaming sentiment analysis data to previous sentiment analysis data on retail investors.  What is currently missing from our project is stock market price data.  This will be implemented at a later time.

# The dataset
The data consists of over 5 million rows of comments pulled from r/wallstreetbets and live sentiment analysis data from Twitter.
